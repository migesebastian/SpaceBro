### Description
SpaceBro is a guessing game with a space theme. Guess the hidden word one letter at a time. You have 6 attempts; each incorrect guess brings the spacebro closer to dying and going into space.

I chose this game for its based on the fact that I'm well aquanted with it since its basically hangman. If you get the word right the "space bro" wont die if you dont guess right he dies.
